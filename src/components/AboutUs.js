            <h1>We share discoveries.</h1>
            <p>
                We are a global community of explorers, who have together created a comprehensive database of the world’s most wondrous places and foods —25,804 of them contributed by our community so far, and more every day, from a secret apartment atop the Eiffel Tower to bridges built out of living roots, from a temple shaped like a chicken to an island ruled by cats, from a fruit that tastes like chocolate pudding to a spicy chutney made out of red ants.
            </p>
            <h1>We report extraordinary stories.</h1>
            <p>
                We are a publisher of best-in-class journalism about hidden places, incredible history, scientific marvels, and gastronomical wonders. Our first book, Atlas Obscura: An Explorer’s Guide to the World’s Hidden Wonders, was a No. 1 bestseller on Amazon and in the New York Times.
            </p>
            <h1>We host local experiences.</h1>
            <p>
                We hold extraordinary events all over the country, every week. In nine U.S. cities, Atlas Obscura Societies create intimate, wondrous experiences for our community. From back-room tours to workshops with the world’s most remarkable people, we give our community access to the rarest experiences.
